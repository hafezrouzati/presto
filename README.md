Presto is an Internet Computer dApp for creating and managing escrows & trusts and for registering ownership of any type of property on-chain.

PRESTO provides the ability to create multi-party escrows with time and condition based unlock subject to the partiesâ€™ explicit approval through the dApp user interface.

All data (recorded as escrow events) related to the escrow, such as important documents (i.e. inspections, operating agreements, cap table, title etc.) including documenting transfer of ownership are managed and stored on-chain and accessible to relevant parties through a single URL.
